# Abstract

&nbsp;

Historically, the monuments we built were rooted in divine or universal principles, where design - from organiztion to the last detail - was concieved as an expression of higher order. With the shift away from these spiritual frameworks towards a more empirical and calculated approach in the 19th century, architecture has been a search for deeper meaning and coherence in its built environment. This thesis aims to address this gap between traditional architectural philosophies and contemporary practices by proposing the Holistic Architecture Theory (HAT), which integrates four fundamental dimensions: Ethos, Aesthesis, Tectonics, and Topos.

&nbsp;

The research utilizes a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical case studies to evaluate how HAT can provide a unified framework for architectural design. By applying this theory to hypothetical and real-world projects, the study assesses its effectiveness in creating balanced and meaningful architectural solutions.

&nbsp;

Key findings demonstrate that HAT offers a comprehensive approach that reconciles historical and modern perspectives, ensuring that all essential dimensions of architecture are addressed. The implications of this research highlight a renewed potential for architecture to achieve both depth and precision in its practice, bridging the gap between abstract ideals and practical realities.
