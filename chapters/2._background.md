The development of the Holistic Architecture Theory (HAT) is deeply rooted in the analysis of existing architectural theories and practices. This section delves into related works that have influenced the conceptualization of HAT and highlights the research gaps and opportunities that the theory aims to address. By examining these gaps, the rationale behind HAT's comprehensive framework becomes clear, demonstrating its relevance and potential impact on contemporary architectural design.

## 2.1 Related Works

The Holistic Architecture Theory draws inspiration from a wide range of architectural philosophies, each of which addresses specific aspects of design. Classical theories emphasize proportion and symmetry, while modernist approaches focus on function and technological progress. Postmodernism, in contrast, embraces complexity and contradiction, challenging traditional norms. However, these theories often lack a cohesive framework that integrates all aspects of architectural practice. HAT seeks to synthesize these diverse perspectives by incorporating the strengths of each into a unified approach that balances the philosophical, aesthetic, structural, and contextual dimensions of design.

## 2.2 Research Gap and Opportunities

Despite the wealth of architectural theories, a significant gap remains in the ability to achieve a truly holistic design approach. Many contemporary projects excel in one or two dimensions, such as aesthetic innovation or structural efficiency, but fall short in others, leading to designs that are unbalanced or contextually inappropriate. This gap presents an opportunity for the Holistic Architecture Theory to offer a new framework that ensures a more comprehensive integration of all essential architectural dimensions. By addressing these gaps, HAT not only provides a pathway for more balanced design outcomes but also redefines the role of the architect in the modern era, enabling a return to a more polymathic approach through the integration of advanced tools and methodologies.
